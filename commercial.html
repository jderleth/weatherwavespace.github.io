    <!-- SECTION: WHY COMMERCIAL PARTNERS CARE -->
    <section class="strip">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Designed For Real Operators, Not Just Demonstrations</h2>
        <p>
          Many commercial users of space data still fight with delayed deliveries, inconsistent coverage,
          or products that were never tuned to their decisions in the first place.
          Weatherwave takes a different approach.  
          We start with government grade sensing requirements, then shape data products that match
          the cadence and reliability commercial partners need in the field.

    <!-- SECTION: THREE CORE COMMERCIAL DOMAINS -->
    <section class="strip">
      <div class="container strip-inner">

        <!-- Card 1: Agriculture and Food Systems -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Agriculture and Food Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Producers, cooperatives, and agtech platforms need more than a single snapshot of a field.
            Weatherwave aims to provide frequent, calibrated views of moisture, heat stress, and crop condition so that:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Growers see problems before they spread</li>
            <li>Advisors can recommend targeted interventions</li>
            <li>Supply chain partners gain earlier insight into regional yield and risk</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The goal is simple: better data that supports better decisions across a growing season.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2: Insurance and Risk -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Insurance and Risk Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            Insurers and risk analytics firms need consistent, objective views of exposure before, during,
            and after events.  
            With a high cadence orbital network, Weatherwave intends to support:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pre event exposure mapping for portfolios and regions</li>
            <li>Near real time impact assessment for hurricanes, floods, and fires</li>
            <li>Long term trend analysis for climate driven risk</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Government grade measurements can anchor actuarial models, parametric products,
            and new classes of climate linked services.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 3: Infrastructure, Energy, and Environment -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Infrastructure, Energy, and Environment</h3>
          <p>
            Operators of critical infrastructure and energy systems need wide area awareness,
            not just local sensors.  
            Weatherwave is being built to support:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Monitoring of corridors, coastlines, and key facilities</li>
            <li>Environmental compliance and condition tracking over large regions</li>
            <li>Support for situational awareness during extreme weather and outages</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The same architecture that serves national missions can give operators a broader,
            more stable view of their systems.

    <!-- SECTION: HOW WEATHERWAVE WORKS WITH COMMERCIAL PARTNERS -->
    <section class="strip">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Working With Weatherwave</h2>
        <p>
          Weatherwave is in the early stages of building its constellation and its production line.
          We expect the most valuable commercial partnerships to come from close collaboration with a small
          number of initial design partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, we anticipate three main ways to work together:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data services</strong> that deliver stable, well calibrated products on predictable schedules</li>
          <li><strong>Joint product development</strong> where Weatherwave sensing is tuned to specific use cases</li>
          <li><strong>Hosted payload opportunities</strong> when a custom instrument makes sense for both sides</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Today, Weatherwave is focused on building the core architecture and validating the most important use cases.
          As the system matures, we intend to open structured pathways for commercial partners to plug in and grow with it.

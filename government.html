        <h2>Weather, Disaster Response, and Earth Science</h2>
        <p>
          The United States depends on high quality space based measurements for weather forecasting, environmental monitoring, and Earth system understanding.  
          Weatherwave is building a cooperative small satellite architecture that works alongside existing systems to increase temporal sampling, improve resilience, and shorten the time from new instrument concept to on orbit data.
        </p>
        <p>
          First priority is operational weather and environmental sensing.  
          Research, technology demonstration, and new observing concepts ride on the same platform, so advances in science directly strengthen operational capability.

          <h3>Operational Weather and Forecasting</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave flocks provide high quality radiometry and environmental sensing using coordinated small satellites.  
            The architecture is designed to support and complement existing national systems by providing:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rapid refresh and continuous technology insertion</li>
            <li>Increased temporal sampling for severe weather awareness</li>
            <li>Resilient architecture with no single points of failure</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Kaizen style iterative improvements ensure the constellation evolves alongside national weather and hazard forecasting needs.

            Fire, flood, hurricane, and volcanic activity require rapid updates and flexible tasking.  
            Weatherwave provides:

          <ul>
            <li>Persistent revisit during evolving crises</li>
            <li>Graceful degradation under asset loss</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Flight opportunities for new instruments on practical timelines</li>

        <h2>National Security and Intelligence Missions</h2>
        <p>
          Modern national security depends on more than individual exquisite systems.  
          It requires persistent awareness, rapid deployment of new capabilities, and architectures that continue to operate under stress.  
          Weatherwave is designed to give defense and intelligence customers these advantages at national scale.

        <!-- Card 1: Purpose-built for Government Missions -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Purpose Built for Government Missions</h3>
          <p>
            Many low Earth orbit imaging constellations were designed primarily for commercial markets and map level imagery.  
            Weatherwave is designed from the start for government grade weather, environmental, and intelligence missions, where calibration, nighttime capability, and responsiveness are central requirements.  
            Our system is not a loose network of cameras.  
            It is a coordinated sensing platform.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2: Persistent High-Cadence Revisit -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Persistent High Cadence Revisit</h3>
          <p>
            Many existing constellations revisit targets every few hours.  
            Weatherwave’s distributed multi flock architecture is designed to provide refresh intervals measured in minutes over prioritized regions.  
            That cadence enables updated situational awareness for coastal operations, logistics nodes, and other high value areas.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 3: Resilience Through Replication -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Resilience Through Replication</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of a small number of billion dollar single points of failure, Weatherwave deploys many satellites that work together.  
            Loss of individual assets does not end the mission.  
            The network adapts, reroutes, and improves over time.  
            This is an architecture designed for contested and uncertain environments.

        <!-- Card 4: ISR and Persistent Change Detection -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance</h3>
          <p>
            ISR increasingly depends on high revisit, multi phenomenology sensing, and reliable change detection rather than isolated single looks.  
            Weatherwave provides:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>High cadence observations across areas of interest</li>
            <li>Multi sensor fusion for dependable detection and tracking</li>
            <li>Automated cueing of exquisite assets through persistent monitoring</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The objective is simple.  
            Give decision makers a continuously updated picture instead of periodic snapshots.

        <!-- Card 5: Cooperative Sensing -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cooperative Sensing, Not Independent Cameras</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional small satellites work alone and produce isolated snapshots.  
            Weatherwave flocks measure as coordinated teams, with multi angle and multi phenomenology observations fused into richer, more stable data products.  
            This supports persistent detection, robust change analysis, and environmental or intelligence insight at operational tempo.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 6: Rapid Deployment -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Rapid Deployment of New Capabilities</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave’s U.S. based production line supports fast integration and flight of new sensors.  
            When a payload meets specification, it can be integrated, tested, and launched on the next available mission, so new capability reaches orbit on timelines measured in weeks rather than years.
          </p>
          <p>
            This responsiveness closes the gap between emerging needs, new instrument concepts, and operational data.

        <h2>Company Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Weatherwave Space, Inc. is an early stage space company focused on high value Earth sensing.
          The company is designing a vertically integrated, rapid production line for small satellites
          and a constellation architecture that uses coordinated groups of spacecraft to deliver
          resilient, high cadence measurements from orbit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The initial focus is on missions that matter at national scale. Weather, climate, environmental
          monitoring, disaster response, and intelligence all benefit from more frequent updates, better
          calibration, and flexible deployment of new sensors. Weatherwave aims to combine those needs
          with modern manufacturing practice to create a continuously improving orbital service.

        <!-- Card 1 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>What Weatherwave Builds</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave is building two connected assets:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A modern smallsat production line in the United States</li>
            <li>A constellation of coordinated satellites that sense as teams</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Together, these enable rapid deployment of new sensors, frequent revisit of areas of interest,
            and an architecture that can evolve over time rather than remaining fixed for a single mission.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Who It Serves</h3>
          <p>
            The primary early customers are expected to be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>National weather and climate agencies</li>
            <li>Civil and defense organizations that rely on environmental intelligence</li>
            <li>Programs that require rapid deployment of new orbital capability</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Future commercial applications may include agriculture, insurance, and environmental risk analytics.

          <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
          <p>
            The number of satellites in orbit is growing, but

      <p>
        Jason Derleth is an aerospace architect, technologist, and strategic leader with more than
        two decades of experience shaping NASA’s most forward-looking missions and technology
        portfolios. His career spans mission systems engineering, national-level architecture
        studies, organizational strategy, and the stewardship of breakthrough aerospace concepts.
      </p>

      <h2>NASA Career</h2>
      <p>
        Jason began his career at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where he served as Deputy
        Mission Systems Engineer during the early formulation of the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity)
        rover. He developed modeling and optimization tools that were adopted widely across the project.
      </p>

      <p>
        He later contributed to the Exploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS) and conducted analysis
        for the Administrator’s office, influencing NASA’s human-spaceflight technology portfolio and
        long-term lunar return strategy. His astronaut-corps strategic workforce study directly informed
        Office of Management and Budget (OMB) decisions regarding astronaut class selection.
      </p>

      <h2>NIAC Leadership</h2>
      <p>
        Jason spent more than a decade as Program Manager and then Program Executive for the NASA
        Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program—the U.S. government’s premier incubator for
        breakthrough aerospace technologies. Under his leadership, NIAC grew in scale, rigor, and
        national impact, launching new companies, accelerating key mission technologies, and inspiring
        multiple DoD and commercial programs.
      </p>

      <h2>Astrophysics & Technology Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        As Chief Technologist for the Physics of the Cosmos and Cosmic Origins programs at NASA
        Goddard, Jason co-architected the early technology strategy for the Habitable Worlds Observatory
        (HWO), NASA’s next flagship astrophysics mission.
      </p>

      <h2>Awards & Recognition</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal</li>
        <li>Space Flight Awareness Honoree Award</li>

        <li>Multiple NASA Group Achievement and Special Act Awards</li>
        <li>NIAC “Captured Lightning” Award</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        Jason holds a master’s degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from MIT and a bachelor’s degree
        in Philosophy & the History of Math and Science from St. John’s College.

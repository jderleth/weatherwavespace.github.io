            NOAA &amp; Federal Weather (~$2.6B) &mdash; U.S. national weather and environmental missions
            require resilient sensing from space but face increasing pressure to incorporate commercial
            providers. The shift toward mixed government–commercial architectures expands this addressable

      <h2>Why Weatherwave Wins Market Share</h2>
      <p>
        Weatherwave integrates modern production methods with coordinated multi-satellite sensing to address
        the growing need for rapid, high-quality environmental intelligence. Rather than relying on infrequent
        flagship missions or single-sensor imagers, our approach emphasizes cadence, calibration, and adaptability.
        The following capabilities highlight the system-level benefits of this architecture.
      </p>

      <!-- Three core differentiation cards -->
      <div class="strip-inner">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>High-Cadence Flocks</h3>
          <p>
            Coordinated flocks of smallsats collaborate as a single instrument, enabling 
            quick refresh over priority regions and higher environmental insight than 
            single-sensor imagers.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Rapid U.S. Production</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave is building a modern smallsat production line that cuts integration 
            and deployment timelines from years to weeks, enabling real operational tempo.

        <div class="market-text">
          <h3>Target Market Penetration</h3>
          <p>
            Given an $18B addressable market, Weatherwave’s initial penetration target is intentionally
            modest at roughly 1–1.5% overall, tailored by segment. We assume small but growing adoption
            across government weather, ISR, and commercial environmental intelligence, leaving substantial
            upside beyond the base case.
          </p>
          <p>
            The penetration model is conservative by design: it reflects what we believe is readily
            achievable for a high-performing constellation and U.S.-based production line, rather than
            an upper bound on demand.

            src="img/Funnel.png" 
            alt="Weatherwave Market Strategy Funnel"
          />
          <p>
            Weatherwave's market strategy starts by fulfilling government needs and then expands to address the larger commercial market.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- RIGHT: Descriptive Text -->
        <div class="market-text">
          <p>
            Weatherwave’s market entry strategy is built around disciplined, phased growth. Our earliest opportunities
            come from government customers with urgent needs: NOAA and the National Reconnaissance Office require
            rapid-cadence weather and environmental intelligence, while NASA and DARPA fund advanced sensing, autonomy,
            and technology development. 
          </p>
          <p>
            These early partnerships provide both non-dilutive capital and technical validation. As Flocks begin flying,
            Weatherwave immediately gains access to commercial demand across agriculture, insurance, supply-chain risk,
            and energy sectors. These markets already rely on satellite data but lack the revisit rates and fused-sensor
            insight our architecture uniquely provides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Weatherwave deploys frequently, upgrades continuously, and manufactures domestically, every new Flock
            makes the constellation more capable, expanding our competitive advantage over static monolithic systems and
            slow-refresh commercial constellations.

          />
        </div>

        <!-- RIGHT: Text explaining TAM × penetration = revenue -->
        <div class="market-text">
          <p>
            At full deployment, our base-case model applies segment-specific penetration targets to the ~$18B TAM,
            resulting in more than $150M in potential annual recurring revenue across government and commercial customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The logic is straightforward: <b>Revenue &asymp; TAM × penetration</b>. We assume modest share of each segment,
            from 1–1.5% by mission class, informed by historical adoption rates for new space systems
            and the premium placed on resilient U.S.-based capabilities. The figures are intentionally conservative and
            are meant to demonstrate that a relatively small share of the market can support a meaningful, durable business.
          </p>

        <div class="market-text">
          <h3>Scaling Margins with a Lean Factory</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave's plans include a satellite manufacturing line steeped in lean thinking. Learning-curve effects
            and vertical integration reduce per-unit costs over time. By building more of the satellite subsystems in-house,
            driving waste out of the flow, and improving efficiency, increasing revenues rapidly translate into expanding margins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result is a production system where each new Flock lowers average cost while increasing constellation capability,
            an attractive profile for both government partners and private investors.

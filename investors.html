            Weatherwave is building a vertically integrated, rapid-production smallsat platform
            designed for the highest value space missions: weather, climate, environmental intelligence,
            and ISR. Our approach blends high cadence sensing, manufacturing efficiency,
            and continuous technology refresh into a scalable orbital service.

    <!-- SECTION: WHY INVESTORS SHOULD CARE -->
    <section class="strip">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>A Platform, Not a Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Most space companies build a single mission or a finite constellation.  
          Weatherwave is building a platform.  
          A rapidly produced, continually upgraded orbital sensing network that grows more capable over time
          and supports multiple markets.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The core asset is the production line itself: a modern American satellite factory capable of
          manufacturing more than one hundred spacecraft per year. This enables recurring revenue,
          predictable scaling, and high strategic value in a market where demand is accelerating.
        </p>
      </div>

        <!-- Card 1 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>A Rapid-Production Satellite Factory</h3>
          <p>
            Vertical integration is the foundation of Weatherwave's model.
            By controlling design, assembly, test, and integration,
            the company eliminates bottlenecks and unlocks scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Existing LEO operators assemble satellites for their own constellations,
            but none operate a fully productized, repeatable, high cadence line that can support
            external missions, hosted payloads, or new government requirements at speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weatherwave is building the first system of this type in the United States,
            aligned to national demand and secure domestic supply.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 2 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>High Value Markets</h3>
          <p>
            Government customers already spend billions per year on weather, climate,
            environmental monitoring, and intelligence data. These missions demand
            calibration, reliability, and performance not achievable with purely commercial imaging fleets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weatherwave is designed to meet government grade requirements while achieving
            smallsat scale economics. This creates a defensible position in high value,
            procurement driven markets that reward stability and long term performance.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Card 3 -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Scalable Business Model</h3>
          <p>
            As the production line ramps, the company gains three scalable revenue vectors:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data services for weather, climate, and ISR customers</li>
            <li>Hosted payloads and rapid deployment for mission specific sensors</li>
            <li>Platform-plus-production contracts for agencies that require on demand capability</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This model allows for compounding returns as the constellation grows
            and as more partners rely on Weatherwave for rapid access to orbit.
          </p>

    <!-- SECTION: LONG TERM STRATEGIC POSITION -->

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Built for Long Term Strategic Value</h2>
        <p>
          The next decade will see thousands of new small satellites launched, but production capacity
          inside the United States remains limited. Weatherwave fills a critical national gap:
          a secure, high tempo, American production line dedicated to resilient sensing architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of vertical integration, high cadence manufacturing, and dual use mission applicability
          positions Weatherwave as a durable infrastructure company with both commercial and government relevance.

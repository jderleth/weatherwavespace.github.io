      <div class="container">
        <h2>Architecture at a Glance</h2>
        <p>
          The diagram above shows the high level Weatherwave concept. A larger service spacecraft leads a group of smaller
          satellites that fly in a coordinated pattern around it as they all orbit Earth. Each flock is one unit of sensing,
          communications, and control within the larger constellation.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION: CONSTELLATION CONCEPT -->
    <section class="strip">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>A Constellation Built From Flocks</h2>
        <p>
          As can be seen above, Weatherwave is not built from single spacecraft. The constellation is built up of independent small satellites (colloquially referred to as "birds" throughout the industry) arranged in "Flocks" of  8-12 "Chicks" (12U cubesats) formation flying around a "Motherbird" (ESPA-class spacecraft.) Each Flock operates as a flagship class system in its own right. Taken together, many Flocks create resilient global coverage.
        </p>

      <div class="container strip-inner">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Motherbird and Chicks</h3>
          <p>
            At the center of each flock is a larger satellite that carries power, data, and communications for the group.
            Around it fly smaller satellites that carry sensors, instruments, and specialized capabilities. The group is
            designed so that the parts work together as one system, not as separate vehicles that simply pass through the
            same orbit.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cooperative Smallsats</h3>
          <p>
            Traditional smallsats act alone. Weatherwave flocks are designed to observe scenes as coordinated teams, with
            multiple view angles and multiple sensing modes. This cooperative approach supports better calibration, richer
            environmental measurements, and more reliable detection of changes on the ground.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Built to Scale</h3>
          <p>
            The flock pattern is designed to be repeatable. Once the first flock is proven, the same production, test, and
            integration flow can be used to build many more. This allows the constellation to grow from a few early flocks
            into a global network without redesigning the architecture each time.

    <!-- SECTION: CADENCE AND COVERAGE -->
    <section class="strip">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Cadence, Coverage, and Responsiveness</h2>
        <p>
          Weatherwave’s architecture is built for operational tempo. It is designed to deliver frequent revisits over
          priority regions, continuous improvement through new flocks, and the ability to field new instruments on meaningful
          timelines.
        </p>

      <div class="container strip-inner">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Frequent Revisit</h3>
          <p>
            Multiple flocks in carefully designed orbits provide refresh intervals measured in minutes over selected regions
            rather than hours. This cadence supports environmental monitoring, disaster response, and national security
            missions that require up to date situational awareness.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Iterative Constellation Growth</h3>
          <p>
            New flocks are added over time as manufacturing capabilities improve. Each new flock can carry updated sensors and
            improved subsystems while remaining compatible with the existing architecture. Once the formation has reached capacity,
            earlier Flocks are deorbited, making room for new state-of-the-art flocks. This allows the constellation to
            evolve without waiting for a once per decade replacement.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Instrument to Orbit in Weeks</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave’s production concept is built around frequent launch opportunities. When an instrument meets the
            agreed specifications, it can be integrated, tested, and flown on the next available mission. This enables
            instrument to orbit timelines measured in weeks rather than years, within the limits of mission assurance and
            safety requirements.

        <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
        <p>
          The Weatherwave architecture is rooted in established practice, but it is organized in a way that supports
          continuous learning and improvement. The points below summarize some of the core design ideas.

          <h3>Orbit and Geometry</h3>
          <p>
            Orbits and fleet geometry are chosen to provide useful coverage patterns for both environmental and security
            missions. Flocks are placed so that they can support high latitude weather phenomena, mid latitude population
            centers, and key regions of interest for national security customers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Cooperative Sensing and Fusion</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave is designed to support multi angle and multi mode sensing, with data combined across satellites and
            over time. This approach supports improved calibration and deeper insight into environmental and human activity
            patterns, compared to single instrument approaches.

        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Production and Integration</h3>
          <p>
            The same underlying design is built many times in a vertically integrated line. Standardized interfaces and
            repeatable test processes shorten build and integration cycles. This supports predictable cost, schedule, and
            risk for each new flock.

        <h2>Where This Architecture Leads</h2>
        <p>
          Weatherwave’s goal is to provide a national scale sensing system that can adapt as quickly as conditions and
          priorities change. The same architecture that supports early weather and environmental missions can grow to serve
          broader defense, civil, and commercial needs over time.

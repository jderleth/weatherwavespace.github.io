        <h2>A New Kind of Space Company</h2>
        <p>Weatherwave is replacing slow, one-off satellite programs with a living orbital platform. We build small, coordinated spacecraft in a lean U.S. production line, and refresh them frequently. Capability grows as we rapidly develop and integrate new technologies.</p>
        <p>Not just a factory. Not just a satellite. Not just today's mission. A carefully crafted system built to evolve as fast as the world demands.</p>

        <h2>A New Kind of Spacecraft: Flocks</h2>
        <p>
          We are building a constellation of small spacecraft that will provide weather sensing
          and Earth imaging rivaling billion dollar satellites at a tiny fraction of the cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can do this because we are rethinking what a spacecraft actually is. Instead of
          one large, expensive satellite, we divide the sensing and observing work across a
          coordinated cluster of smaller, less expensive spacecraft. By flying them as a team
          and fusing their data with advanced algorithms, we turn the cluster into something
          more capable than a single monolithic system.

  <!-- SECTION: CORE VALUE PILLARS -->
  <section class="strip">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Four Pillars of Success</h2>
      <p>
        Weatherwave is built around four principles that turn a smallsat constellation into an
        evolving orbital capability:
      </p>

      <div class="value-grid">

        <!-- Pillar 1: Coordinated Sensing -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Coordinated Sensing</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave flocks measure as a team, not as isolated cameras. Multiple smallsats
            observe the same scene from different angles and with different instruments, which
            allows sensor fusion and more reliable environmental intelligence than single sensor
            systems can provide. 
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Pillar 2: Persistent High-Cadence Coverage -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Persistent High-Cadence Coverage</h3>
          <p>
            Instead of waiting hours for a single satellite pass, Weatherwave is designed to
            refresh priority regions in minutes. Constellation geometry and coordinated tasking
            provide the temporal density needed for fast moving weather, environmental events, and
            time critical operations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Pillar 3: Resilience Through Replication -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Resilience Through Replication</h3>
          <p>
            A distributed constellation with many similar spacecraft avoids single points of
            failure. Individual satellites can be lost, replaced, or upgraded without sacrificing
            mission performance, so critical coverage continues even when hardware is taken offline.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Pillar 4: Continuous Improvement -->
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
          <p>
            Weatherwave treats the constellation as a continuously improving product. A lean,
            U.S. based production line allows new sensors, design refinements, and software
            upgrades to be flown regularly, so capability grows over time instead of remaining
            frozen for a decade.
